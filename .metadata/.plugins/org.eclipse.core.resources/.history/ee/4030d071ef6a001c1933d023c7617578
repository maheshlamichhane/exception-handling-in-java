Throw:-> Sometimes we can create exception object explictly we can handover to the JVM manually for this
we have to use throw keyword.hence the main objective of throw keyword is to handover our created 
exception to the JVM manually.

Note:-> best use of throw keyword is for user-defined exception or customized exception.

Case1:-> throw e if e refers null then we will get null pointer exception.
Case2:-> after throw statement we are not allowed to write any statement directly.
