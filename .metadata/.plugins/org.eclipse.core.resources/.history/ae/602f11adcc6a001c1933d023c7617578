Customize Excepiton Handling By Using Try Catch:-> it is highly recomended to handle exception.the code
which may rise an exception is called riskey code and we have to define that code inside try block and 
corresponding handling code we have to define inside catch block.
try{
riskey code
}
catch(Exception e){
handling code
}
