Exception:->An unexpected unwanted event that disturbs normal flow of the program is called exception.
for example tired punchured exception,sleeping exception,file not found exception etc.
it is highly recomended to handle exceptions and the main objective of excception handling is 
graceful termination of the program.
Excption handling doesn't mean repairing an exception.we have to provide alternative way to continue
rest of the program normally is the concept of exception handling.for exaple our programming 
requireent is to read data from remote file locating at london at runtime if london file is not
available our program should not be terminated abnormally.we have to provide some local file to 
continue rest of the program normally.this way of defining alternative is nothing but exception
handling.

Runtime Stack Mechanism:-> For every thread JVM will create a runtime stack.each and every method
call performed by that thread will be stored in the corresponding stack.each entry in the stack is
called stack frame or activation record.after completing every method call the corresponding entry
from the stack will be removed.after completing all method call the stack will become empty and that
empty stack will be destroyed by JVM just before terminating the thread.

Default Exception Handling:-> Inside a method if any exception occurs,the method in which it is rised
is responsible to create exception object by including the following information
-> name of exception
-> description of excepiton
-> location at which exception occurs(stack trace)

after creating a exception object method handover that object to the JVM.
JVM will check whether the method contains any exception handling code or not.if the method doesn't
contain exception handling code then JVM terminate that method abnormally and removes the corresponding
entry from the stack.
