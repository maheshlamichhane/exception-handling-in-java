Try with resources:-> until 1.6 version it is highly recomended to write finally block to close
resources which are open as a part of try block.the problem in old appoach are
i. compulsary programmer is required to close resources inside finally block it increases 
complexity of programming.
ii. we have to write finally block compulsary and hence it increases lenght of the code and reduces
redability.

to overcome above problems sun people introduces try with resources in 1.7 version.the main 
advantage of try with resources is whatever resources we open as a part of try block wll be closed
automatically once control reaches end of try block either normally of abnormally and hence we
are not required close explictly so that complexity of programming will be reduced.
we are not required to write finally block so that length of the code will be reduced and 
readibility will be improved.we can declare multiple resources but these resources should be 
separated should with semicolon.
all resources should be auto closable resources.a resource is said to be autoclosable if and only
if corresponding class implements java.lang.AutoClosable interface.all io related resources,database
related resources and network related resources are already implemented autoclosable interface.
