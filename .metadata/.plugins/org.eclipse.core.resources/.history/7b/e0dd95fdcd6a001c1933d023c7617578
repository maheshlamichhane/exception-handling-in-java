Customize Excepiton Handling By Using Try Catch:-> it is highly recomended to handle exception.the code
which may rise an exception is called riskey code and we have to define that code inside try block and 
corresponding handling code we have to define inside catch block.
try{
riskey code
}
catch(Exception e){
handling code
}



Control Flow in Try Catch:-> 

try{
	Statement1
	Statement2
	Statement3
}
catch(Exception e){
	Statement4
}
Statement5

case1:-> if there is no exception
Statement1
Statement2
Statement3
Statement5
normal termination

case2:-> if exception rise at statement 2 and corresponding catch block match then 
Statement1
Statement4
Statement5
normal termination

case3:-> if an exception rise at statement 2 and corresponding catch block not match then
Statement1
abnormal termination
