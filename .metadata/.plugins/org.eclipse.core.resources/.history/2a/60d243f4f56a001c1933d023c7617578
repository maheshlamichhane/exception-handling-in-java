Throw:-> Sometimes we can create exception object explictly we can handover to the JVM manually for this
we have to use throw keyword.hence the main objective of throw keyword is to handover our created 
exception to the JVM manually.

Note:-> best use of throw keyword is for user-defined exception or customized exception.

Case1:-> throw e if e refers null then we will get null pointer exception.
Case2:-> after throw statement we are not allowed to write any statement directly otherwise we will get
compile time error saying unreachable statement.
Case3:-> we can use throw keyword only for throwable types.if we are trying to use for normal java 
objects we will get compile time error saying encompitable types.

Throws:-> In our program if there is posibility of rising checked exception then compulsary we should 
handle that checked exception otherwise we will get compile time error saying unreported exception XXX
must be caught or declared to be thrown.we can handle this compile time error by using the following two
ways.
i. By using try catch
ii. By using Throws keyword

we can use throws keyword to delegate responsibility of exception handling to the caller(it may be another
method or JVM) then caller method is responsible to handle that exception.

throws keyword requires only for checked exceptions and usage of throws keyword for unchecked exceptions there
is no use or impact.throws keyword requires only to convince compiler and usage of throws keyword doesn't
prevent abnormal termination of the program.

Note:-> it is recomended to use try catch over throws keyword.
