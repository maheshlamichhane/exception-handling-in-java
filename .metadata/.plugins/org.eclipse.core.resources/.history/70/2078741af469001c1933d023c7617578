Exception:->An unexpected unwanted event that disturbs normal flow of the program is called exception.
for example tired punchured exception,sleeping exception,file not found exception etc.
it is highly recomended to handle exceptions and the main objective of excception handling is 
graceful termination of the program.
Excption handling doesn't mean repairing an exception.we have to provide alternative way to continue
rest of the program normally is the concept of exception handling.for exaple our programming 
requireent is to read data from remote file locating at london at runtime if london file is not
available our program should not be terminated abnormally.we have to provide some local file to 
continue rest of the program normally.this way of defining alternative is nothing but exception
handling.
