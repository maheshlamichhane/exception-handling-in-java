sometimes to meet programming requirement we can define our own exceptions such type
of exception are called customized or user defined exception.

Top 10 Exception:-> based on the person who is rising an exception all excetpion are
divided into 2 categories.
i.JVM Exception
ii. Programatic Exception

JVM Exception:-> The exception which are rise automatically by JVM whenever a particular
event occur are called JVM Exceptions.example arithmetic exception,null pointer exception,
etc.

Programatic Exception:-> The exceptions which are rised explictly either by programmer
or by API Developer to indicate that something goes wrong are called programatic exception.
for example TooOldException,IllegalArgumentException etc.

i.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException:-> it is the child class of runtime exception and hence 
it is  unchecked.rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying access array element
with the out of range index.

ii. NullPointerException:-> it is the child class of runtime exception and hence it is
unchecked.rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to perform any operation on
null.

iii. ClassCastException:-> it is the  child class of runtime exception and hence it is
unchecked.rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to type cast parent object
to child type.

iv. StackOverflowError:-> it is the child class of error hence it is unchecked.rised automatically
by JVM whenever we are trying to perform recursive method call.

v. NoClassDefFoundError:-> it is the child class of erro hence it is unchecked. rised automatically
by JVM whenever JVM unable to find required .class file.

vi. ExceptionInInitializerEroor:-> it is the child class of error hence it is unchecked.rised 
automatically by JVM if any exception occure while executing static variable assignment and
static blocks.

vii. IllegalArgumentException:-> it is the child class of runtime exception and hence it is unchecked.
rised explictly either by programmer or by API Developer to indicate that method has been invoked
with illegal argument.example the valid range of thread priority

viii.NumberFormatException:-> it is the direct child class of illegalargument exception which is the
child class of runtime exception and hence it is unchecked.rised explictly either by programmer or
by API Developer to indicate that we are trying to convert string to number and string is not 
properly formatted.

ix. IllegalStateException:-> it is the child class of runtime exception and hence it is unchecked.
rised explictly either by programmer or by API developer to indicate that a method has been invoked 
at wrong time.example,after starting of a thread we are not allowed to restart same theread again 
otherwise we will get runtime exception saying illegalthreadstate exception.

x. AssertionsError:-> it is the child class of error and hence it is unchecked.rised explictly by
the programmer or by API Developer to indicate that assert statement fails. if x is not greater 10 
then we will get runtime exception saying assertions error.
